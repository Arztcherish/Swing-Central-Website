      <p class="font-weight-bold">What is West Coast Swing? </p>
      <p class="mb-4">West Coast Swing is a fun, social partner dance that originated in the United States of America, and has since taken the rest of the world by storm.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold">I haven't danced before - is this class for me? </p>
      <p class="mb-4">Definitely! We love having new dancers in our community, and many people start from having had no previous dance experience. </p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold">Do I need to book in advance? </p>
      <p class="mb-4">No! Just turn up on any Tuesday ready to do some dancing. We teach beginners classes every week - so you don't need to book in for a course.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold">Do I need to bring a dance partner? </p>
      <p class="mb-4">No! We rotate partners during the class, so you will get to dance with everyone in the room. However, do feel free to bring friends along!</p>
